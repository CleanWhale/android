There are a couple issues with this, and you should know about them before you do any work with this (for some reason).

1. Error 7 when flashing - This is due to the updater-script verifying the System Image after flashing. I've attempted
to fix this once, and it didn't work. The changes needed should be in "ota_from_target_files.py" in "sourceDirectory/build/
tools/releasetools".

2. Call audio is broken on Verizon Wireless - For some reason, calls work fine on every carrier except Verizon.
I've tried *multiple* times to fix this. I've changed the libs used for audio, I've changed build.prop settings, I've
tried changing multiple settings which effect audio and/or telephone communications and nothing has worked (some of these
attempts haven't been pushed to Github).

    If you can get both of these issues fixed, you will have a 100% fully functioning AOSP ROM.
